# Sprint Plan: Sprint 1 - The Foundation

## Sprint Goal
To establish the project's technical foundation by implementing the modular architecture, core data layers, and the basic UI shell. This will prepare the app for rapid feature development in subsequent sprints.

## User Stories for Sprint 1

### Story 1: Project Architecture Setup
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want** the project set up with the defined modular structure (Feature, Core, Data, Domain modules)
*   **so that** we can ensure a clean, scalable codebase from the start.

### Story 2: Local Data Persistence
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want** to implement the SwiftData persistence layer for shows and episodes
*   **so that** the app can store data locally for offline access.

### Story 3: Remote Networking Layer
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want** to create the TMDB API client using Alamofire
*   **so that** we can fetch show data from the remote service.

### Story 4: Basic UI Shell
*   **As a** developer,
*   **I want** to implement the main app container with the three-tab bottom navigation (Discover, Collections, Settings)
*   **so that** the basic application structure is in place.
