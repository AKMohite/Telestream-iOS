# Technical Architecture Specification: Telestream (Version 1.0)

## 1. Guiding Principles

*   **Modularity & Separation of Concerns**: The architecture must enforce a clear separation between the UI, business logic, and data layers to ensure the application is easy to maintain, scale, and test.
*   **Offline-First**: The application must be fully functional offline. The architecture will treat the local database as the primary source of truth, with the network used for synchronization.
*   **Performance**: The design will prioritize performance, especially in UI responsiveness and data handling, by leveraging modern Swift concurrency and efficient data management.

## 2. Core Architecture Pattern

We will adopt a **Clean Architecture** approach combined with the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** pattern for the presentation layer.

*   **Why this pattern?**
    *   **Clean Architecture** provides an excellent separation of concerns by dividing the app into distinct layers (Presentation, Domain, Data). This is ideal for managing the complexity of an offline-first app.
    *   **MVVM** is the standard for SwiftUI applications. It works seamlessly with SwiftUI's state management and data-binding features provided by the Combine framework.

*   **Layer Breakdown**:
    *   **Presentation Layer**: Contains SwiftUI Views and ViewModels. Views are responsible for the UI, while ViewModels handle presentation logic and state management.
    *   **Domain Layer**: The core of the application. It contains the business logic, use cases (e.g., "FetchTrendingShows," "AddShowToWatchlist"), and entity definitions. This layer is independent of any UI or data-sourcing frameworks.
    *   **Data Layer**: Manages all data operations. It includes repositories that fetch data from either the local database or the remote API, abstracting the data source from the rest of the app.

## 3. Data & Networking Layer

*   **Persistence (Offline Storage)**:
    *   **Technology**: We will use **SwiftData** as specified in the PRD. It is Apple's modern framework for data persistence and integrates natively with SwiftUI.
    *   **Strategy**: The app will implement an "offline-first, sync-on-connect" model. All reads and writes will happen directly against the local SwiftData store.
*   **Data Caching & Synchronization**:
    *   **Mechanism**: Data fetched from the TMDB API will be stored in SwiftData with a timestamp. Data older than the specified 3-hour validity will be marked as stale.
    *   **Sync Logic**: A background task will periodically check for a network connection. If available, it will refresh stale data from the TMDB API.
*   **Networking**:
    *   **API Client**: A dedicated service will be created to handle all communication with the TMDB API.
    *   **Library**: We will integrate **Alamofire** to simplify networking requests and response handling.

## 4. Key Libraries & Tools

All libraries will be managed via the **Swift Package Manager (SPM)**.

| Category         | Library/Tool        | Purpose                                                                                                             |
| :--------------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Networking**   | `Alamofire`         | A robust, industry-standard library to simplify networking requests, validation, and response handling.             |
| **Image Handling** | `Kingfisher`        | For downloading and caching the vast number of show posters and banners from the TMDB API.                          |
| **Code Quality**   | `SwiftLint`         | To enforce a consistent code style and identify potential errors, ensuring the codebase remains clean.              |
| **Animations**     | `Lottie` (Optional) | Can be used to implement complex, high-quality animations for loading states or other UI enhancements.          |

## 5. Platform & Responsiveness

The UI will be built entirely with **SwiftUI** and the **Combine** framework. The use of adaptive layouts, as specified in the UI/UX document, will be a core focus to ensure the app feels native and looks great on iPhone, iPad, and macOS.

*   **Layer Breakdown**:
    *   **Presentation Layer**: SwiftUI Views and ViewModels.
    *   **Domain Layer**: Core business logic, use cases, and entities.
    *   **Data Layer**: Repositories managing data from local and remote sources.

## 3. Project Modularization

To enforce our architecture and improve build times, the project will be broken down into several independent Swift Packages. This creates a clear dependency graph and promotes code reuse.

*   **App Target**: The main application executable that assembles and launches the app.
*   **Feature Modules**: Each major feature will be a self-contained module.
    *   `DiscoverFeature`: Contains the UI and logic for the Discover tab.
    *   `CollectionsFeature`: Contains the UI and logic for the Collections tab.
    *   `ShowDetailFeature`: The screen showing details for a specific show.
    *   `SettingsFeature`: The UI and logic for the Settings tab.
*   **Core Modules**: Shared functionality used across feature modules.
    *   `DataLayer`: Implements the repository pattern, housing the TMDB API client and the SwiftData persistence logic.
    *   `DomainLayer`: Contains the core business models and use case definitions (e.g., `Show`, `Episode`, `FetchTrendingShowsUseCase`).
    *   `UIComponents`: A library of shared SwiftUI components (e.g., `ShowPosterCard`, `LoadingIndicator`, custom buttons) used across all features.
    *   `Navigation`: A small module to manage routing and deep-linking between features.

*   **Dependency Flow**:
    *   `App Target` -> Depends on all `Feature Modules` and `Navigation`.
    *   `Feature Modules` -> Depend on `DomainLayer`, `DataLayer`, `UIComponents`, and `Navigation`.
    *   `Core Modules` -> `DataLayer` depends on `DomainLayer`. The other core modules are independent.

## 4. Data & Networking Layer

*   **Persistence**: **SwiftData** for the offline-first database.
*   **Synchronization**: A 3-hour data validity with background refresh.
*   **Networking**: **Alamofire** for handling TMDB API requests.
