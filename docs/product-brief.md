Thank you for providing these crucial details. This clarifies the core value proposition of Telestream and gives us a solid foundation for the PRD.

As the **Product Manager**, I have integrated your answers into the PRD. The document is now much more detailed and provides a clear roadmap for the team.

Here is the updated version of the PRD for Telestream:

2. **Problem Statement**
    * The modern TV landscape is fragmented across numerous streaming platforms (Netflix, Disney+, etc.). Users struggle to keep track of where shows are available and what to watch next, forcing them to navigate multiple apps. Telestream solves this by centralizing content discovery, providing personalized recommendations based on viewing habits, and notifying users about new episodes and shows, regardless of the streaming service.
